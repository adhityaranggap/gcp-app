                Recognizing a Graphics File

• Graphic files contain digital photographs, line art,
  three-dimensional images, and scanned replicas of
  printed pictures
      – Bitmap images: collection of dots
      – Vector graphics: based on mathematical
        instructions
      – Metafile graphics: combination of bitmap and
        vector
• Types of programs
      – Graphics editors
      – Image viewers

       Understanding Bitmap and Raster
                   Images
• Bitmap images
      – Grids of individual pixels
• Raster images - also collections of pixels
      – Pixels are stored in rows
      – Better for printing
• Image quality
      – Screen resolution - determines amount of detail
      – Software contributes to image quality (drivers)
      – Number of color bits used per pixel

           Understanding Vector Graphics

• Characteristics of vector graphics
      – Uses lines instead of dots
      – Store only the calculations for drawing lines and
        shapes
      – Smaller than bitmap files
      – Preserve quality when image is enlarged
• CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator



Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   5
         Understanding Metafile Graphics

• Metafile graphics combine raster and vector
  graphics
• Example
      – Scanned photo (bitmap) with text (vector)
• Share advantages and disadvantages of both types
      – When enlarged, bitmap part loses quality




Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   6
  Understanding Graphics File Formats

• Standard bitmap file formats
      –   Portable Network Graphic (.png)
      –   Graphic Interchange Format (.gif)
      –   Joint Photographic Experts Group (.jpeg, .jpg)
      –   Tagged Image File Format (.tiff, .tif)
      –   Window Bitmap (.bmp)
• Standard vector file formats
      – Hewlett Packard Graphics Language (.hpgl)
      – Autocad (.dxf)

      Understanding Digital Camera File
                  Formats

• Witnesses or suspects can create their own digital
  photos
• Examining the raw file format
      – Raw file format
             • Referred to as a digital negative
             • Typically found on many higher-end digital cameras
      – Sensors in the digital camera simply record pixels on
        the camera’s memory card
      – Raw format maintains the best picture quality

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   9
      Understanding Digital Camera File
                  Formats

• Examining the raw file format (cont’d)
      – The biggest disadvantage is that it’s proprietary
             • And not all image viewers can display these formats
      – The process of converting raw picture data to
        another format is referred to as demosaicing
• Examining the Exchangeable Image File format
      – Exchangeable Image File (Exif) format
             • Commonly used to store digital pictures
             • Developed by JEITA as a standard for storing
               metadata in JPEG and TIF files

      Understanding Digital Camera File
                  Formats

• Examining the Exchangeable Image File format
  (cont’d)
      – Exif format collects metadata
             • Investigators can learn more about the type of digital
               camera and the environment in which pictures were
               taken
      – Viewing an Exif JPEG file’s metadata requires
        special programs
             • Exif Reader, IrfanView, or ProDiscover
      – Exif file stores metadata at the beginning of the file

       Understanding Data Compression

• Some image formats compress their data
      – GIF and JPEG
• Others, like BMP, do not compress their data
      – Use data compression tools for those formats
• Data compression
      – Coding data from a larger to a smaller form
      – Types
             • Lossless compression and lossy compression


Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   17
       Lossless and Lossy Compression
• Lossless compression
      – Reduces file size without removing data
      – Based on Huffman or Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding
             • For redundant bits of data
      – Utilities: WinZip, PKZip, StuffIt, and FreeZip
• Lossy compression
      – Permanently discards bits of information
      – Vector quantization (VQ)
             • Determines what data to discard based on vectors in the
               graphics file
      – Utility: Lzip

• Operating system tools
      – Time consuming
      – Results are difficult to verify
• Digital forensics tools
      – Image headers
             • Compare them with good header samples
             • Use header information to create a baseline analysis
      – Reconstruct fragmented image files
             • Identify data patterns and modified headers

     Identifying Graphics File Fragments

• Carving or salvaging
      – Recovering any type of file fragments
• Digital forensics tools
      – Can carve from file slack and free space
      – Help identify image files fragments and put them
        together




Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   20
              Repairing Damaged Headers

• When examining recovered fragments from files in
  slack or free space
      – You might find data that appears to be a header
• If header data is partially overwritten, you must
  reconstruct the header to make it readable
      – By comparing the hexadecimal values of known
        graphics file formats with the pattern of the file
        header you found



Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   21
              Repairing Damaged Headers

• Each graphics file has a unique header value
• Example:
      – A JPEG file has the hexadecimal header value
        FFD8, followed by the label JFIF for a standard
        JPEG or Exif file at offset 6
• Exercise:
      – Investigate a possible intellectual property theft by a
        contract employee of Exotic Mountain Tour Service
        (EMTS)

• Before attempting to edit a recovered graphics file
      – Try to open the file with an image viewer first
• If the image isn’t displayed, you have to inspect
  and correct the header values manually
• Steps
      – Recover more pieces of file if needed
      – Examine file header
             • Compare with a good header sample
             • Manually insert correct hexadecimal values

            Reconstructing File Fragments

• Locate the noncontiguous clusters that make up a
  deleted file
• Steps
      – Locate and export all clusters of the fragmented file
      – Determine the starting and ending cluster numbers
        for each fragmented group of clusters
      – Copy each fragmented group of clusters in their
        correct sequence to a recovery file
      – Rebuild the file’s header to make it readable in a
        graphics viewer

        Identifying Unknown File Formats

• Knowing the purpose of each format and how it
  stores data is part of the investigation process
• The Internet is the best source
      – Search engines like Google
      – Find explanations and viewers
• Popular Web sites
      – www.fileformat.info/format/all.htm
      – http://extension.informer.com
      – www.martinreddy.net/gfxl

Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   42
         Analyzing Graphics File Headers

• Necessary when you find files your tools do not
  recognize
• Use a hexadecimal editor such as WinHex
      – Record hexadecimal values in the header and use
        them to define a file type
• Example:
      – XIF file format is old, little information is available
      – The first 3 bytes of an XIF file are the same as a TIF
        file
      – Build your own header search string

                    Tools for Viewing Images
 • After recovering a graphics file
       – Use an image viewer to open and view it
 • No one viewer program can read every file format
       – Having many different viewer programs is best
 • Most GUI forensics tools include image viewers
   that display common image formats
 • Be sure to analyze, identify, and inspect every
   unknown file on a drive

        Understanding Steganography in
                Graphics Files

• Steganography hides information inside image files
      – An ancient technique
• Two major forms: insertion and substitution
• Insertion
      – Hidden data is not displayed when viewing host file
        in its associated program
             • You need to analyze the data structure carefully
      – Example: Web page

        Understanding Steganography in
                Graphics Files
• Substitution
      – Replaces bits of the host file with other bits of data
      – Usually change the last two LSBs (least significant
        bit)
      – Detected with steganalysis tools (a.k.a - steg tools)
• You should inspect all files for evidence of
  steganography
• Clues to look for:
      – Duplicate files with different hash values
      – Steganography programs installed on suspect’s drive

                    Using Steganalysis Tools

• Use steg tools to detect, decode, and record
  hidden data
• Detect variations of the graphic image
      – When applied correctly you cannot detect hidden
        data in most cases
• Check to see whether the file size, image quality, or
  file extensions have changed



Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations, Fifth Edition   © Cengage Learning 2015   54
   Understanding Copyright Issues with
               Graphics
• Steganography has been used to protect
  copyrighted material
      – By inserting digital watermarks into a file
• Digital investigators need to aware of copyright
  laws
• Copyright laws for Internet are not clear
      – There is no international copyright law
• Check www.copyright.gov
      – U.S. Copyright Office identifies what can and can’t
        be covered under copyright law in U.S.
